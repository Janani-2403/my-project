    <h1>MYSORE PALACE</h1>
    <p>
        Mysore Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace, is a historical palace and a royal residence.
        <br> It is located in Mysore, Karnataka, India. It used to be the official residence of the
        <br> Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of 
        <br>Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the 
        br'City of the Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one. However,
        <br> the Mysore Palace refers specifically to the one within the new fort.
<br><br>
The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru (literally, "citadel"). 
<br>The first palace inside the Old Fort was built in the 14th century, which was set ablaze
<br> and reconstructed multiple times. The Old Fort was built of wood and thus easily 
<br>caught fire, while the current fort was built of stone, bricks and wood. 
<br>The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace burnt down,
<br> the current structure is also known as the New Fort. Mysore Palace is one of the most 
<br>famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than three million
<br> annual visitors as on 2014.[1]

<section><b><h2>Architecture</h2></b>
<p1>
    Designed by Henry Irwin, an English architect, the style is that of Indo-Saracenic architecture,
    <br> with elements from Islamic, Rajput, and Gothic architecture styles.[8] It is a three-story,
    <br> gray granite,[9] structure, about 75 m (245 ft) long and about 48 m (156 ft) wide.
    <br>[8] There are square towers, five stories tall, at each of the cardinal points,
    <br> topped with pink domes.[10][9] The tallest tower, 44 m (145 ft) tall,[9][8] is 
    <br>at the centre of the palace and is topped with a gold plated dome.[8]
<br><br>
The façade has arches, canopies, and bay windows.[8] There are seven arches and two 
<br>smaller arches that connect to the centralized arch of the façade.[8] Above the 
<br>central arch is a sculpture of Gajalakshmi.[8] The palace is surrounded by gardens.
<br>[8] It has four entrances:[10] The 'Jaya Maarthaanda' (main entrance) to the East, 
br'Jayarama' to the North, 'Balarama' to the South, and 'Varaha' to the West.[10]
