    <h1>MUNNAR</h1>
    <p>
        Munnar (IPA: [muːn̪ːɐːr]) is a town located in the Idukki district of the southwestern Indian state of Kerala.
        <br> Munnar is situated at around 1,600 metres (5,200 ft) above mean sea level,[4] in the Western Ghats mountain range. 
        <br>This ancient plantation settlement, dominated by its tea industry, is also a growing modern hill station.
<br><br>
The name Munnar is a combination of the words "Munnu" and "Aaru" in the local languages of Malayalam/Tamil meaning 
br"three rivers",[5] referring to its location at the confluence of the Muthirapuzha, Nallathanni and Kundali rivers.[6]

</p>
<section><b><h2>HISTORY</h2></b>
<p1>The region has been inhabited by hunter-gatherer tribals like the Malayarayan and Muthuvan for thousands of years.[7]
    <br> In the early days, only Tamils and few Malayalis lived there. They were brought as workers in the tea plantations.
    <br> Tradition states that Colonel Arthur Wellesley, later the Duke of Wellington, was the first British person
    <br> to pass through Munnar[8] during Tipu Sultan's campaign in Travancore, but this is unsubstantiated.
    <br> The first survey of the terrain was undertaken by Benjamin Swayne Ward in 1816–1817, who followed 
    <br>Periyar into the Western Ghats and established a camp at the confluence of three rivers, from which
    <br> the name of Munnar is derived.[9]
<br><br>
It was to be nearly 50 years later that Sir Charles Trevelyan, Governor of Madras, instructed Col. 
<br>Douglas Hamilton to explore the hill country in the western part of the Madras Presidency, 
<br>requesting special advice on the feasibility of establishing sanatoria for the British in 
<br>the South[10] and of developing revenue- earning projects without endangering the environment, 
<br>as had happened in Ceylon where coffee had destroyed not only the rain forest but also paddy 
<br>cultivation in the north-central rice bowl of ancient Ceylon. Hamilton climbed throughout
<br> the Ghats in Munnar region. 15 years later, John Daniel Munro noted that much of Munnar's 
<br>land was suitable for coffee plantations. Munro, Henry Turn, and his half-brother AW Turner 
<br>obtained ownership of the Cardamom Hills from the Raja of Travancore and began clearing forest
<br> around Devikulam in 1879. Soon many other Europeans began establishing tea plantations in the
<br> area throughout the 1880s. Early plantations had few facilities and were mainly huts of straw.
<br><br>
Eventually roads were opened to the lowlands and in Bodinayakanur in western Madras Presidency, 
<br>planters got provisions from a local headman - Suppan Chetty. He and his son, 
<br>Alaganan Chetty (later an MLA) would continue providing supplies to the tea estates in the region. 
<br>By 1894, 26 estates were established in the hills, but all were facing losses. 
<br>In 1897, a separate company, Kannan Devan Hills Corporation (KDHC) was registered to
<br> operate the tea estates which was later taken over by the American Direct Tea Trading Company Ltd.,
<br> who owned 26 estates, most with coffee and some with cinchona, almost all in the area except for a few in the lower areas.
<br><br>
In 1900, a ropeway was built and eventually monorails were installed for easier transport of goods to the plains.
<br> In 1901, P. R. Buchanan took over as General Manager and began the most extensive clearing of jungles for plantations.
<br> In 1908, construction started on a new railway which opened in 1909. By 1911, around 16,000 acres of the region 
<br>was under cultivation.
<br><br>
In 1924, a flood swept through Munnar, damaged the road and destroyed the rail track.[11] In its place it 
<br>was decided to create a ropeway to transport tea. In 1930, this in turn was replaced by a modern
<br> road that made transport much easier. By 1952, almost 28,000 acres of land was under cultivation.
<br> After Independence, Indian planters took over. In 1964, the KDHC which owned most tea estates was
<br> acquired by Tata and Finlay who started the first instant tea factory in the country.[12] In 1971, 
<br>the Kerala government wanted to reforest all land in the hills not used for plantations. However,
<br> negotiations that followed resulted in Tata keeping most of the land, leaving it with 57,000 acres.
<br><br>
To this day, most tea estate labourers are landless. In the early 2000s, the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi,
<br> a Dalit outfit from Tamil Nadu, started demanding land for the labourers, started making inroads into Kerala.
<br> In 2009, VS Achuthanandan promised his support for providing land to the mainly Tamil Dalit estate labourers.
<br> However, the process became very slow and as of 2018, most families still hand no land.[13]
<br><br>
The former Kunda Valley Railway in Munnar was destroyed by a flood in 1924, but in 2019 tourism officials 
<br>were considering reconstructing the railway line to attract more tourists to the area.[14]
