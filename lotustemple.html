    <h1>LOTUS TEMPLE</h1>
    <p>
        The Lotus Temple is a Baháʼí House of Worship in Kalkaji, New Delhi, Delhi, India.
        <br> It was completed in December 1986. Notable for its lotus-like shape, 
        <br>it has become a prominent attraction in the city. Like all Bahá’í Houses of Worship,
        <br> the Lotus Temple is open to all people, regardless of religion or any other qualification.
        <br> The building is composed of 27 free-standing marble-clad "petals" arranged in
        <br> clusters of three to form nine sides,[1] with nine doors opening onto a central hall
        <br> with a height of slightly over 34 metres[1] and a capacity of 1,300 people.
        <br>[2] The Lotus Temple has won numerous architectural awards[3][4] and has been 
        <br>featured in many newspaper and magazine articles.[5]

<section><b><h2>HISTORY</h2></b>
<p1>
    The architect of the Lotus Temple was an Iranian, Fariborz Sahba, who now lives in
    <br> La Jolla, California,[6] after spending some years in Canada.[7] He was 
    <br>approached in 1976 to design the Lotus Temple and later oversaw its construction.
    <br> The structural design was undertaken by the British firm Flint and Neill over
    <br> the course of 18 months,[8] and the construction was done by ECC Construction
    <br> Group of Larsen & Toubro Limited[9][dead link] at a cost of $10.56 million.
    <br>[10][11] The major part of the funds needed to buy this land was donated by
    <br> Ardishír Rustampúr, of Hyderabad, Sindh (Pakistan), whose will stipulated 
    <br>that his entire life savings would go towards the building of the temple.
    <br>[12][page needed] A portion of the construction budget was saved and used to
    <br> build a greenhouse to study indigenous plants and flowers that would be appropriate for use on the site.[13]
<br><br>
Rúhíyyih Khánum laid the foundation stone for the Lotus Temple on 19 October, 1977, 
<br>and dedicated the temple on 24 December 1986.[14] For the dedication, there was 
<br>a gathering of 8,000 Baháʼís from 107 countries, including some 4,000 Baháʼís
<br> from 22 states in India. The temple was opened to the public on 1 January 1987
<br> and more than 10,000 people visited that day.[15]
