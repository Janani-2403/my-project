        New Delhi (/ˈnjuː ˈdɛ.li/ ⓘ;[6] Hindi: Naī Dillī, pronounced [ˈnəiː ˈdɪlːiː]) 
        <br>is the capital of India and a part of the National Capital Territory of Delhi (NCT). 
        <br>New Delhi is the seat of all three branches of the Government of India, hosting the 
        <br>Rashtrapati Bhavan, Sansad Bhavan, and the Supreme Court. New Delhi is a municipality
        <br> within the NCT, administered by the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC), which covers mostly
        <br> Lutyens' Delhi and a few adjacent areas. The municipal area is part of a larger 
        <br>administrative district, the New Delhi district.

<br><br>
Although colloquially Delhi and New Delhi are used interchangeably to refer to the 
<br>National Capital Territory of Delhi, both are distinct entities, with the municipality 
<br>and the New Delhi district forming a relatively small part within the megacity of Delhi.
<br> The National Capital Region is an even larger entity, comprising the entire NCT along
<br> with adjoining districts in the two neighbouring states forming a continuously built-up 
<br>area with it, including Ghaziabad, Noida, Greater Noida, Meerut, YEIDA City, Gurgaon, and Faridabad.

<br><br>
The foundation stone of New Delhi, south of central Delhi, was laid by George V 
<br>during the Delhi Durbar of 1911.[7] It was designed by British architects Edwin 
<br>Lutyens and Herbert Baker. The new capital was inaugurated on 13 February 1931,[8] by
<br> Viceroy and Governor-General Irwin.
