        The Government Botanical Garden is a botanical garden in Udhagamandalam, near Coimbatore (Ooty),
        <br> Tamil Nadu state, India laid out in 1848.[3] The gardens, divided into several sections,
        <br> cover an area of around 22 hectares (54 acres), and lie on the lower slopes of Doddabetta peak.[4]

<section><b><h2>History</h2></b>
<p1>
    The Government Botanical Garden, Udhagamandalm, was established in 1848. Its architect was William Graham McIvor.
    <br>[7] The Marquis of Tweedale prepared the initial layout during the late 1840s. 
    <br>The gardens were established by a subscription of Rs 3 per month amongst the European residents
    <br> for the purpose of supplying vegetables at a reasonable cost. During the time that Ootacamund was 
    <br>under British control, considerable cultivation of vegetables for the market was carried on by the European
    <br> settlers and others. Captain Molyneux of the 2nd European Regiment managed the vegetable cultivation.
    <br> The subscribers received vegetables free of cost. But this arrangement did not work out and in early 1847,
    <br> a fund was raised by means of donations and subscriptions with a view to forming a horticultural 
    <br>society and a public garden.
