        Ooty (Tamil: [uːʈ(ː)i] ⓘ; officially Udagamandalam (Tamil: [uðɐhɐmɐɳɖɐlɐm]), 
        <br>anglicized: Ootacamund listenⓘ, abbreviated as Udagai, Tamil: [uðɐhɐi]) is
        <br> a town and municipality in the Nilgiris district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
        <br> It is located 86 km (53 mi) northwest of Coimbatore, and is the headquarters of
        <br> Nilgiris district. Situated in the Nilgiri hills, it is known by the epithet
        <br> <mark>"Queen of Hill Stations"</mark> and is a popular tourist destination.

<br><br>
Originally occupied by the Toda people, the area came under the rule of the East India
<br> Company in the 18th century. It later served as the summer capital of Madras Presidency.
<br> The economy is based on the hospitality industry serving tourism and agriculture. 
<br>The town is connected to the plains by the Nilgiri ghat roads and Nilgiri Mountain Railway.

<br><br>
The region was earlier known as Ottakal Mandu, with Otta-kal meaning 'single stone' in Tamil,
<br> a reference to a sacred stone revered by the local Toda people and Mandu, 
<br>a Toda word for 'village'.[4] This later became Udagamandalam which was anglicised to
<br> Ootacamund by the British, with the first part of the name (Ootaca), a corruption of the
<br> local name for the region and the second part (Mand), a shortening of the local Toda word Mandu.
<br>[5][6][7] The first known written mention of the place is given as Wotokymund in a letter dated
<br> March 1821, written to the Madras Gazette by an unknown correspondent.[8] Ootacamund was later
<br> shortened to Ooty. Ooty is in the Nilgiri hills, meaning the "blue mountains", so named due 
<br>to the Kurunji flower, which used to give the slopes a bluish tinge.[9]
