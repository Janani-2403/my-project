<section><b><h2>History</h2></b>
<p2>
    Its name is derived from the local language, Kannada and is named so due to the 
    <br>direction that river flows in. ‘Bala’ in the state’s language means,
    <br> ‘Right’ while ‘Muri’ is ‘Turn.’ As the river flows slightly in a right
    <br> direction, the dam thus, got its name. [3]
<br><br>
The dam was constructed in attempts to hold water of the Cauvery River. It was mainly
<br> built to help and control irrigation of the fields surrounding the river.
<br> Once it fills up, river water falls down a length of 6 to 7 feet from over
<br> the dam wall.[3] The length of the dam approximately 1.6 km and drops off
<br> into the flow of mini waterfall due to a descent of 6 feet. [4]
