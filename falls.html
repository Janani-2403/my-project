<section><h2>GEOGRAPHY</h2>
<p1>Tirparappu Waterfalls are a 300 ft (91 m) long rocky riverbed, at a height of nearly 50 ft (15 m).
    <br> The waterfall flows with great force for around seven months. The bed above the falls is a rocky mass
    <br> extending up to a distance of about quarter of a kilometre upstream, with a weir constructed 
    <br>for supplying water to nearby paddy fields.
<br><br>
Near the falls is a fortified temple dedicated to Shiva, called the Mahadever Kovil.
<br> It is third of the twelve Shivalayas, famous for the Shivalaya Ottam during the Indian festival 
<br>of Shivaratri. Devotees believe Mahadev lives here as Virabhadra, a fierce incarnation of
<br> Shiva to kill Daksha Prajapati, after the death Satidevi. There are many old inscriptions in this temple 
<br>including one of the Pandiya King dated ninth century. 
<br>This temple is built around A.D. 9th century.[citation needed]
