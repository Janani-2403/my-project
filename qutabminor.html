    <h1>QUTAB MINOR</h1>
    <p>
        The Qutb Minar, also spelled Qutub Minar and Qutab Minar, is a minaret and victory
        <br> tower comprising the Qutb complex, which lies at the site of Delhi's oldest 
        <br>fortified city, Lal Kot, founded by the Tomar Rajputs.[3] It is a UNESCO World
        <br> Heritage Site in the Mehrauli area of South Delhi, India.[4][5] It was mostly
        <br> built between 1199 and 1220, contains 399 steps, and is one of the most-frequented 
        <br>heritage spots in the city.[6][7][4] After defeating Prithviraj Chauhan,
        <br> the last Hindu ruler of Delhi before the Ghurid conquest of the region,
        <br>[8][9] Qutab-ud-din Aibak initiated the construction of the victory tower, 
        <br>but only managed to finish the first level. It was to mark the beginning of
        <br> Islamic rule in the region. Successive dynasties of the Delhi Sultanate 
        <br>continued the construction, and, in 1368, Firuz Shah Tughlaq rebuilt the 
        <br>top parts and added a cupola.[10]
<br><br>
It can be compared to the 62-metre all-brick Minaret of Jam in Afghanistan, of c.
<br>â€‰1190, which was constructed a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower.
<br>[11] The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns.
<br> The Qutb Minar has a shaft that is fluted with "superb stalactite bracketing under the balconies" 
<br>at the top of each stage.[12][13][14] In general, minarets were slow to be used in India 
<br>and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist.[15]
<br><br>
In recent years, the Qutub Minar has been illuminated for special occasions
<br> involving international relations. In September 2023, the monument was lit
<br> up in the colours of the Mexican flag to commemorate Mexico's 213th Independence Day, 
<br>an event that was acknowledged and appreciated by the Embassy of Mexico in India.[16] Similarly,
<br> on October 30, the Qutub Minar was illuminated with the Turkish flag to commemorate the
<br> 100th anniversary of the Republic of Turkey, an occasion that received special attention
<br> from the Turkish Embassy in New Delhi.[17]

<section><b><h2>Architecture

<p1>
    The tower includes elements of traditional Islamic architecture and southwestern Asian design.
    <br> Elizabeth Lambourn's Islam Beyond Empires: Mosques and Islamic Landscapes in India 
    <br>and the Indian Ocean studies the introduction of Islam in South Asia and how the region
    <br> influenced the Islamic religious architecture.[18] These newly arrived Muslims from the 
    <br>Islamic West escaped the Mongol Empire and emigrated to India, where they constructed 
    <br>religious centers. The Qutb Minar serves as a central marker to these new Muslim communities 
    <br>as well as being a reminder of Islam's presence in the area.[18] The architecture of the minaret
    <br> varies greatly from that of the typical style and design of the mosques constructed in the 
    <br>Middle East. The style of these structures is influenced by the local architecture such as
    <br> the Indic temples. This affected the different materials, techniques, and decoration that
    <br> were used in the construction of the Qutb Minar.[18]
<br><br>
Historically, tower minarets were uncommon in South Asian-Islamic design until the 17th century,
<br> due to the slow adoption of the typical Middle Eastern style in India.[18] It is also 
<br>detached from the main mosque, showcasing how the native culture affected the design 
<br>of a Middle Eastern structure.[15] The Qutb Minar is seen as the "earliest and best 
<br>example of a fusion or synthesis of Hindu-Muslim traditions" according to Ved Parkash
<br> in his essay The Qutb Minar from Contemporary and Near Contemporary Sources.
<br>[18] Like many mosques built in South Asia during this time period, the minaret
<br> was constructed by Hindu laborers and craftsmen but overseen by Muslim architects.
<br>[18] This led to a construction that synthesized both Hindu and Islamic religious architecture.
<br> Since some of the craftsmen were Hindu and unfamiliar with the Quran, the inscriptions are a
<br> compilation of disarranged Quranic texts and other Arabic expressions.[18]
