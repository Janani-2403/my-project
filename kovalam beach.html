    <h1>KOVALAM BEACH</h1>
    <p>
        Kovalam is a beach and seaside resort in the city of Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, India. 
        <br>Kovalam is located 12.6 km (7.8 mi) southeast of the city center. The beaches around Kovalam
        <br> are popular vacation destinations for both domestic and international travellers.[1]
<br><br>
Kovalam first received attention when the Regent Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi of Travancore constructed
<br> her beach resort, Halcyon Castle, here towards the end of the 1920s.[3] Thereafter, the place was
<br> brought to the public eye by her nephew, the Maharaja of Travancore.[4] The European guests of the
<br> then Travancore kingdom discovered the potential of Kovalam beach as a tourist destination in the 1930s.
<br> In the early 1970s, many hippies came on their way to Ceylon via the hippie trail, beginning the
<br> transformation of a casual fishing village in Kerala into a significant tourist destination.[5]
