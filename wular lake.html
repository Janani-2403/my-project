    <h1>WULAR LAKE</h1>
    <p>
        Wular Lake (Urdu pronunciation: [ʋʊlər]), also known as Wolar 
        <br>(Kashmiri pronunciation: [ʋɔlar]) in Kashmiri, is one of 
        <br>the largest freshwater lakes in the Indian subcontinent.
        <br>[3] It is located near Bandipora town in the Bandipora
        <br> district of Jammu and Kashmir, India.[4] The lake basin was
        <br> formed as a result of tectonic activity and is fed by the
        <br> Jhelum River and the streams Madhumati and Arin.
<br><br>
The lake's size varies seasonally from 30 to 189 square kilometres.
<br> In addition, much of the lake has been drained as a result of 
<br>willow plantations being built on the shore in the 1950s.

<section><b><h2>History</h2></b>
<p1>The Kashmiri sultan Zain-ul-Abidin is reputed to have ordered the
    <br> construction of the artificial island of Zaina Lank in the 
    <br>middle of the lake in 1444.[8]
<br><br>
According to the traditional beliefs in the vicinity of Wular Lake,
<br> there once stood a city whose king was Raja Sudrasen.
<br> By the reason of the enormity of his crimes, the waters of the 
<br>lake rose and drowned him and his subjects. It was said that 
<br>during the winter months, at low water, the ruins of the submerged 
<br>idol temple might be seen rising from the lake. Zayn Ul Aabidin
<br> constructed a spacious barge which he sank in the lake and upon 
<br>which he laid a foundation of bricks and stones till it rose high 
<br>enough to be at level as the water. Upon this, he erected a Mosque
<br> and other buildings and gave the islet the name of Lanka.
<br> The expense of this work was defrayed by the fortunate discovery
<br> of two idols of solid gold, which had been brought up from the lake by divers.[9]
