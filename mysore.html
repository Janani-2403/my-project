Mysore (/maɪˈsɔːr/ ⓘ my-SOR), officially Mysuru (Kannada: [ˈmaɪˈsuːɾu] ⓘ), is a city in the
<br> southern Indian state of Karnataka.[5] It is the headquarters of Mysore district 
<br>and Mysore division. As the traditional seat of the Wadiyar dynasty, the city functioned 
<br>as the capital of the Kingdom of Mysore for almost six centuries (1399 to 1947). Known for
<br> its heritage structures, palaces (such as the famous Mysore Palace), and its culture,
<br> Mysore has been called the "City of Palaces", the "Heritage City",[6] and the  
<br>"Cultural capital of Karnataka".[7] It is the second-most populous city in the state
<br> and one of the cleanest cities in India according to the Swachh Survekshan.

<br><br>
Mysore is situated at the foothills of the Chamundi Hills. At an altitude of 770 m (2,530 ft) 
<br>above mean sea level, the city of Mysore is geographically located at 12° 18′ 26″ north latitude 
<br>and 76° 38′ 59″ east longitude. It is about 140 km (87.0 mi) southwest of the state's capital,
<br> Bangalore, and spreads across an area of 156 km2 (60 sq mi) (city and neighbouring census towns).
<br>[8] The population of the city combined with its neighbouring towns in its metropolitan area is
<br> about 1,288,000 in 2023.[9]

<br><br>
Most of the city's development during modern times could be attributed to the maharajas
<br> of Mysore and the Wadiyar dynasty, who were patrons of art and culture. Hyder Ali
<br> and Tipu Sultan, when they were briefly in power in succession, also contributed 
<br>significantly to the economic growth of the city and the kingdom by planting mulberry trees
<br> and silk in the region, and fighting four wars against the British. In present days, 
<br>the Mysore City Corporation is responsible for the civic administration of the city.

<br><br>
During the Dasara festivals, Mysore receives hundreds of thousands of tourists from around the world.
<br> The city is also the namesake to various art forms and culture, such as Mysore Dasara and
<br> Mysore painting; foods such as the sweet delicacy Mysore pak; breakfasts like Mysore Dosa 
<br>and Mysore Masala Dosa; brands such as Mysore Sandal Soap and Mysore Paints; and styles and
<br> cosmetics such as Mysore peta, a traditional silk turban, and the Mysore silk saris. 
<br>Mysore is also known for betel leaves and its own special variety of jasmine flower
<br> fondly referred to as "Mysore mallige". Tourism is a lifeline industry for the city 
<br>alongside the traditional industries. Mysore's intracity public transportation includes bus
<br> and intercity public transportation includes rail, bus, and air.[10]
