    <h1>GURUVAYUR TEMPLE</h1>
    <p>
        Guruvayur Temple is a Hindu temple dedicated to Guruvayurappan (four-armed form of the Vishnu),
        <br> located in the town of Guruvayur in Kerala, India. Administrated by the Guruvayur Devaswom Board,
        <br> it is one of the most important places of worship for Hindus across the world and is often
        <br> referred to as Bhuloka Vaikunta (Holy Abode of Vishnu on Earth).[2] The temple is 
        <br>classified among the 108 Abhimana Kshethram of Vaishnavate tradition.
<br><br>
The central icon is a four-armed standing Vishnu carrying the conch Panchajanya,
<br> the discus Sudarshana, the mace Kaumodaki, and a lotus with a tulasi garland.
<br> This image represents the form of Vishnu as revealed to Krishna's parents Vasudeva
<br> and Devaki around the time of his birth. Worship proceeds according to routines
<br> laid down by Adi Shankara and later written formally in the Tantric way,
<br> the inter-religious spiritual movement that arose in medieval India, by Chennas 
<br>Ravinarayanan Nambudiri (1427-1527), whose descendants are the hereditary tantris 
<br>(high priests) of the Guruvayur Temple.[3]
<br><br>
The temple is managed by a special administrative authority under the control of the
<br> Government of Kerala. The main festivals of this temple are the 10-day festival in
<br> the Malayalam month of Kumbham starting with flag hoisting on Pooyam star,[4]
<br> Krishna Janmashtami (Birthday of Krishna) in the month of Chingam,[5] Ekadasi 
<br>(11th day) in the shukla paksha (bright fortnight) in the month of Vrischikam, 
<br>popularly called as the Guruvayur Ekadasi[6] and Vishu on the first day of the
<br> month of Medam, once a harvest festival.[5]
<br><br>
The temple's sub-deities are Ganapathi, Ayyappan, and Bhagavathi (Who is given more importance),
<br> and there are two sub-temples, one for Ganapati and the other for Nagadevathas 
<br>Snake deities nearby the temple. All non-Hindus are prohibited from entry within the Guruvayur Temple.

<section><b><h2>Pre-colonial age</h2></b>
<p1>
    In the 14th century, the Tamil literature "Kokasandesam" refers to a place named "Kuruvayur" and in the 16th century (fifty years after Narayaniyam was composed) there are also multiple references to Kuruvayur[by what?]. In Old Tamil, "kuruvai" means "sea", hence the village on the Malabar Coast may be called Kuruvayur.[9]
<br><br>
The earliest temple records date back to the 17th century. The earliest mention of the many important Vishnu temples of Kerala are found in the songs of Alvars, the Tamil poet-saints, whose time-line is not exactly fixed.[10] However, by the end of 16th century, Guruvayur had become the most popular pilgrimage centre in Kerala.

    In 1716, the Dutch raided Guruvayur. They looted treasures and set fire to the Western
    <br> Gopuram (later rebuilt in 1747). In 1755, the Dutch destroyed the Trikkunavay 
    <br>temple and the Brahmins fled from there.
<br><br>
In 1766, Hyder Ali of Mysore captured Kozhikkode (Calicut) and then Guruvayur.
<br> He demanded 10,000 fanams in ransom to spare the temple. The ransom was paid 
<br>but due to insecurity pilgrims receded. On the request of the Malabar Governor,
<br> Shrnivasa Rao, Hyder Ali granted a Devadaya to save the temple. Later, in 1789 CE,
<br> Tipu Sultan invaded the province. Tipu destroyed the smaller shrines and set fire
<br> to the Temple, but it was saved due to timely rain. Tipu lost to the Travancore and 
<br>the English in 1792. The idol, which had been hidden underground in anticipation of 
<br>the Tippu's takeover, was re-installed on 17 September 1792.[11]
<br><br>
Ullanat Panikkars rescued and looked after the temple from 1825 to 1900. 
<br>From 1859 to 1892, the Chuttambalam, the Vilakkumatam, the Koottambalam 
<br>and Sasta shrine were renovated and roofed with copper sheeting. In 1900, the administrator Konti 
<br>Menon fixed the hours of worship and led the drive to keep the temple premises clean. 
<br>He set up the big bell and reconstructed Pathayappura (granary). In 1928, Kozhikode once again 
<br>became the administrator of Guruvayur.[12][clarification needed]
