<section><b><h2>history</h2></b>
<p1>
    Mysore Zoo was created from the private menagerie of Chamaraja Wadiyar X,
    <br> the twenty-third Maharaja of Mysore. in 1892, on 10 acres (4.0 ha) 
    <br>of the Summer Palace. Over the next 10 years, the zoo was expanded 
    <br>to 45 acres (18 ha) with spacious enclosures that are still in use.[2]
<br><br>
Originally called the Palace Zoo, it was renamed "Chamarajendra 
<br>Zoological Gardens" in 1909. A.C. Hughes, from South Wales,
<br> was the zoo's first superintendent, serving from 1892 to 1924. 
<br>Hughes, Sir Mirza Ismail, and G.H. Krumbiegel worked towards 
<br>refashioning the zoo and updating it with modern, natural enclosures. 
<br>It now features a bandstand and an artificial lake.
<br><br>
In 1948, management of the zoo was devolved to the Department of Parks
<br> and Gardens, Government of Mysore. The zoo was expanded first with 
<br>another 50 acres (20 ha), and then another 150 acres (61 ha) with
<br> the acquisition of the Karanji Tank, in which an artificial island
<br> has been created as a sanctuary for birds.[2] In 1972, the zoo was 
<br>entrusted the Forest Department and later in 1979 to the Zoo 
<br>Authority of Karnataka, the first autonomous organisation in
<br> India to manage a zoo.[2]
<br><br>
The zoo had completed 100 years in 1992. The centenary celebrations
<br> were held in 1990 and 91. During the centenary celebrations 
<br>various developmental activities were initiated such as renovation
<br> and modification of the entrance gate, hospital building, 
<br>walkthrough reptiles, etc. A bust of Chamaraja Wadiyar X was unveiled.
<br> The logo of the zoo, centenary souvenir, publication of literature
<br> and leaflets, conducting various competitions, preparation of a 
<br>documentary film were other highlights.[2][6]
