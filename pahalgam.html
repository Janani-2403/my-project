<section><b><h2>Geography</h2></b>
<p1>
    Pahalgam is located in Anantnag district of the Indian union territory of 
    <br>Jammu and Kashmir.[1][10] It is located at an altitude of 2,200 m
    <br> (7,200 ft) in the Lidder Valley, which extends east of Jhelum River
    <br> in the Vale of Kashmir.[6][11] The two streams of Lidder River—East
    <br> and West Lidder—join near Pahalgam before proceeding through the narrow valley.
    <br>[12] At Pahalgam, the valley divides into two, one heading towards Amarnath in
    <br> the northeast and another leading to Aru in the northwest.
    <br>[6] The region is made up of volcanic and limestone rocks interspersed
    <br> with asymmetrical roche rocks.[13] The vegetation in the region is dominated 
    <br>by evergreen fir and coniferous trees such as pine and spruce.[14]
