    <h1>DAL LAKE</h1>
    <p>
        Dal is a freshwater lake in Srinagar, the summer capital of 
        <br>Jammu and Kashmir in Indian-administered Kashmir. It is 
        <br>an urban lake, the second largest lake in Jammu and Kashmir,
        <br> and the most visited place in Srinagar by tourists and locals.
        <br> It is integral to tourism and recreation in the Kashmir valley
        <br> and is variously known as the "Lake of Flowers",[1] "Jewel in
        <br> the crown of Kashmir"[2] or "Srinagar's Jewel".[3] The lake is
        <br> also an important source for commercial operations in fishing 
        <br>and water plant harvesting.[4][5][6]
<br><br>
The shore line of the lake, about 15.5 kilometres (9.6 mi), 
<br>is encompassed by a boulevard lined with Mughal era gardens, parks,
<br> houseboats and hotels. Scenic views of the lake can be witnessed 
<br>from the shore line Mughal gardens, such as Shalimar Bagh and Nishat 
<br>Bagh built during the reign of Mughal Emperor Jahangir,[7] and from 
<br>houseboats cruising along the lake in the colourful shikaras.
<br>[8] During the winter season, the temperature can sometimes reach as
<br> low as −11 °C (12 °F), freezing the lake.[6][9]

<section><b><h2>Topography</h2></b>
<p1>
    The lake is located within a catchment area covering 316 square kilometres 
    <br>(122 sq mi) in the Zabarwan mountain valley, in the foothills of the
    <br> Shankaracharya Hill, which surrounds it on three sides. The lake,
    <br> which lies to the east and north of Srinagar city covers an area 
    <br>of 18 square kilometres (6.9 sq mi), although including the floating
    <br> gardens of lotus flowers, it is 21.2 square kilometres (8.2 sq mi) 
    <br>(an estimated figure of 22–24 square kilometres (8.5–9.3 sq mi) is 
    <br>also mentioned).[5][6][26] The main basin draining the lake is a 
    <br>complex of five interconnected basins with causeways; the Nehru
    <br> Park basin, the Nishat basin, the Hazratbal basin, the Nigeen basin 
    <br>and the Barari Nambal basin. Navigational channels provide the
    <br> transportation links to all the five basins.[5][6][26]

<section><b><h2>Geology</h2></b>
<p1>
    Multiple theories explaining the origin of this lake have been formulated.
    <br> One version is that it is the remnants of a post-glacial lake, which 
    <br>has undergone drastic changes in size over the years and the other theory
    <br> is that it is of fluvial origin from an old flood spill channel or ox-bows
    <br> of the Jhelum River.[8][27] The dendritic drainage pattern of the 
    <br>catchment signifies that its rock strata have low levels of porosity. 
    <br>Lithologically, a variety of rock types have been discerned namely, 
    <br>igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary. The Dachigam Telbal Nallah system 
    <br>is conjectured to follow two major lineaments. Discontinuous surfaces seen 
    <br>in the terrain are attributed to the angular and parallel drainage pattern.
    <br> The water table cuts the hill slopes, which is evidenced by the occurrence
    <br> of numerous springs in the valley. Seismic activity in the valley is recorded
    <br> under Zone V of the Seismic Zoning Map of India, the most severe zone where
    <br> frequent damaging earthquakes of intensity IX could be expected. 
    <br>In the year 2005, Kashmir valley experienced one of the severe earthquakes
    <br> measured at 7.6 on the Richter's scale, which resulted in deaths and the
    <br> destruction of many properties, leaving many homeless.[13][28]

<section><b><h2>Flora and fauna</h2></b>
<p3>
    The ecosystem of Dal is ecologically rich in macrophytes, submerged macrophytes,
    <br> floating macrophytes and phytoplankton.[5][31][32] Macrophyte flora
    <br> recorded in the lake's aquatic and marshland environment consists of 117 species, 
    <br>belonging to 69 genera and 42 families.[33] The lake is noted in particular for 
    <br>its Nelumbo nucifera (lotus) which bloom in July and August. The prolific growth
    <br> of Ceratophyllum demersum in the eutrophic zones has been reported, with
    <br> Myriophyllum spicatum and Potemogetton lucens cited as dominant species.
    <br> Other macrophytes discerned in different zones of the lake include Typho angustata,
    <br> Phragmites australis, Myriophyllum, Sparganium evectum and Myriophyllum 
    <br>verticillatum, which contribute to the production of macrophytes. 
    <br>The rooted variety of the floating leaf type consists of Nelumbo nucifera,
    <br> N. alba, N. tetragonia, N. candida, Nymphoides peltata, Salvinia natans, 
    <br>Hydrocharis dubia, and Potamogeton natans, all of which occupy 29.2% of the lake.
    <br>[5][34] Phytoplanktons include Navicula radiosa, Nitzschia accicularis, 
    <br>Fragilaria crotonensis, Diatoma elongatum, Scenedesmus bijuga, Pediastrum duplex,
    <br> Tetraedron minimum, Microcystis aeruginosa and Merismopedia elegans.
