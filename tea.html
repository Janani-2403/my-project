    <h1>TEA MUSEUM</h1>
    <p>
        The Nilgiris is one of the pioneers in tea production and export.
        <br> Railway lines were built to transport tea from Nilgiris to Cochin.
        <br> A large number of Indians are ardent lovers of this beverage which originated in China. 
        <br>To all the chai lovers out there! How about sipping your favourite drink directly
        <br> from its production centre, amidst the lush green hills? It would be an experience worth 
        <br>a lifetime! The Ooty tea factory situated four kilometres away from Ooty city also has a tea museum
        <br><br>
        Situated at an altitude of 1839 metres and spread over an acre on Doddabetta Road, the tea 
        <br>factory takes you through the process of making tea right from plucking tea leaves to the
        <br> packaging of tea powder. By visiting the factory, you will get to learn on the history of tea 
        <br>in India and its evolution in the Nilgiris hills. It will also tell you about the origin of
        <br> different kinds of tea leaves used across the world.  There is a tea museum inside the factory 
        <br>which educates you on the cutting, twisting, and curling (CTC) methods of tea leaves using machines.
<br><br>
Each stage of tea production like withering, rolling, drying, and finally, the shifting stages are shown
<br> to the visitors with the help of a video. The tea leaves are dried in a stainless-steel container
<br> and are passed through crushers before passing through CTC. 

Souvenirs like tea cups, tea plates and t-shirts are available where the Tea museum logo is engraved on them.
<br> These products are handcrafted. While visiting the factory, you will also be served hot tea and you
<br> can choose which flavour you need among cardamom tea, masala tea, ginger tea, green tea and many other flavours.
<br> There is also a chocolate production section in the factory where we can see how chocolates are prepared from
<br> cocoa powder to chocolate paste and moulding in various shapes. You can also buy homemade chocolates like
<br> fruits and nuts, fig and honey, raisins and nuts, milk and coffee chocolate and sugar-free varieties.
