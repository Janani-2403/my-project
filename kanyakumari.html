            <td><p>Kanniyakumari is a special destination in many different ways. 
        <br>It is the southernmost tip of the mainland of India. <br>Three major water bodies – the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal 
        <br>and the Indian Ocean – converge right here in Kanniyakumari.
        <br>
         Such a geographically blessed destination is rare and these features make Kanniyakumari
         <br>  one of the most visited places in India annually. 
         <br><br>
         The place gets its name from the Hindu goddess Devi Kanniyakumari, 
         <br>who is considered to be the sister of Lord Krishna.
         <br>
          When the Dutch East India Company conquered Portuguese Ceylon from the
          <br> Portuguese East Indies, the name Kanniyakumari was shortened to Comorin.
          <br> Eventually during the British regime in India, the destination began to be called
          <br> Cape Comorin. Later, the Government of India renamed it as Kanniyakumari. 
          <br><br>
          What Kanniyakumari offers to a passionate traveller are many spectacular joys.
          <br>
           Of course being a coastal region Kanniyakumari has great beaches
           <br> that are perfect to spend vacations at. 
           <br>Then there are spectacular monuments that remind you about the
           <br> rich cultural heritage that Kanniyakumari has to offer. 
           <br>Then comes various temples, churches, waterfalls
           <br> – all adding up to the stunning experiences that make 
           <br>Kanniyakumari a must-explore destination.
           <br> Kanniyakumari is the only spot in India from where you can watch the 
           <br>spectacle of the sunset and the moonrise happening simultaneously on Full Moon days.
           <br> It’s even grander during the day of ‘Chithra Pournami’
           <br> when the Sun and the Moon will appear facing each other in the same horizon.
