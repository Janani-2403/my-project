    <h1>RED FORT</h1>
    <p>
        The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːl qɪlaː]) is a historic Mughal
        <br> fort in Delhi, India, that served as the primary residence of the Mughal emperors.
        <br> Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned the construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1639, 
        <br>following his decision to relocate the Mughal capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally 
        <br>adorned in red and white, the fort's design is attributed to Ustad Ahmad Lahori, the 
        <br>architect behind the Taj Mahal. The Red Fort represents the pinnacle of Mughal 
        <br>architecture during Shah Jahan's reign, blending Persian palace influences with 
        <br>indigenous Indian architectural traditions.
<br><br>
The fort was plundered and stripped of its artwork and jewels during Nadir Shah's invasion 
<br>of the Mughal Empire in 1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently
<br> demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive 
<br>walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was subsequently used as a garrison.
<br><br>
On 15 August 1947, the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, raised the Indian 
<br>flag above the Lahori Gate. On India's Independence Day, observed annually on 15 August,
<br> the Prime Minister ceremonially raises the Indian tricolour flag at the main gate of the 
<br>historic fort and delivers a nationally broadcast address from its ramparts.
<br><br>
The Red Fort, as part of the Red Fort Complex, was recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2007.[1][2]

    The Red Fort, the largest monument in Delhi,[43] is one of its most popular tourist 
    <br>destinations[44] and attracts thousands of visitors every year.[45] It is a monument
    <br> of national significance; each year on India's independence day, observed on 
    <br>August 15, the Prime Minister hoists the national flag at the Red Fort and delivers
    <br> a speech from its ramparts, which is broadcast nationwide.[46] The fort also appears 
    <br>on the back of the ₹500 note of the Mahatma Gandhi New Series of the Indian rupee.[47]
<br><br>
The Red Fort's architectural features are in varying states of preservation. 
<br>While some structures remain relatively intact, retaining their original decorative elements, 
<br>others have suffered significant damage, with inlaid marble floral designs removed by looters.
<br> The water features, once extensive, are now dry. The tea house, though not preserved in its 
<br>historical form, functions as a working restaurant. The mosque and the hammam (public baths)
<br> are closed to visitors, who can only view them through glass windows or marble latticework.
<br> Walkways within the complex are deteriorating, and public toilets are available both at the
<br> entrance and inside the premises. The Lahori Gate serves as the main entrance, leading to a 
<br>shopping area with jewelry and craft stores. The complex also houses a museum of 
br"blood paintings," which narrate the stories of 20th-century Indian martyrs, alongside an
<br> archaeological museum and an Indian war-memorial museum.[citation needed]
