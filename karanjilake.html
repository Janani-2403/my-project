    <h1>KARANJI LAKE</h1>
    <p>
        Karanji Lake (also known as Fountain Lake) is a lake located in 
        <br>the city of Mysore in the state of Karnataka, India.
        <br> The lake is surrounded by a nature park consisting of 
        <br>a butterfly park and a walk-through aviary.[1] This aviary 
        <br>is the biggest 'walk-through aviary' in India.[2] There
        <br> is also a museum, the Regional Museum of Natural History 
        <br>which is located on the banks of this lake. The total area
        <br> of Karanji lake is 90 hectares. While waterspread area is 
        <br>about 55 hectares, the foreshore area measures about 35 hectares.
        <br>[3] Karanji lake is owned by the Mysore Zoo Authority.
        <br>[4] Mysore Zoo gets a revenue of an average of Rs. 50000 per day
        <br> from ticket sales to enthusiasts who visit this lake.[5]

<section><b><h2>History</h2></b>
<p1>
    Karanji Lake was one of the favourite haunts of migratory birds like
    <br> herons and egrets. But the lake started getting polluted when 
    <br>sewage from the nearby residential areas were let into the lake.
    <br> This pollution led to the destruction of aquatic life in the lake 
    <br>and with the food-source getting depleted, the migratory birds
    <br> started to avoid the lake.[3]
<br><br>
In order to prevent the destruction of this lake and to renovate it,
<br> help was sought from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Karnataka
<br> Urban Infrastructure Development Finance Corporation (KUIDFC) and
<br> Zoo Authority of Karnataka (ZAK). These three organisations 
<br>came together and undertook the restoration activities of this lake.
<br>[3] Financial help of Rs. 12 million was provided by ADB and ZAK 
<br>undertook the restoration work with the co-ordination of KUIDFC.
<br><br>
The first step undertaken was to stop the sewage from entering the lake.
<br> Other restoration activities included removal of polluted silt, 
<br>de-weeding of the entire lake surface, removing 30 cm of silt 
<br>from the lake, restoration of feeder channels, construction of a 
<br>jetty to start boating facility, and the construction of a bridge 
<br>to the newly created 'butterfly park'. A watch tower was also 
<br>constructed to view the birds and study their behaviour. 
<br>A giant fountain which can spew water up to 40 feet has been 
<br>recently added as an attraction.[5] A nursery of medicinal plants is also present here.

    Some of the common migratory birds found here are grey pelican,
    <br> painted stork, ibis, cormorant, egret, etc. which nest on trees
    <br> in the islands present in the lake. Recent survey of birds have
    <br> indicated 147 species. Indian peacocks and peahens are the most
    <br> common birds present here, given that it is the National bird of India.
    <br>[9] Herons, Asian open bill storks, egrets, red wattle lapwing, 
    <br>sandpipers, rose ringed parakeet, black drongo, brown shrike,
