        <br> There is a reserved forest area around the peak. It is 9 km from Ooty, 
        <br>on the Ooty-Kotagiri Road in the Nilgiris District of Tamil Nadu, India.
        <br> It is a popular tourist attraction with road access to the summit.

        <br> closely linked summits in the west of the Doddabetta range near to Udagamandalam.
