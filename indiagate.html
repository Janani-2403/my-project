    <h1>INDIA GATE</h1>
    <p>
       The India Gate (formerly known as All India War Memorial) is a war memorial located
        <br> near the Rajpath (officially called Kartavya path) on the eastern edge of the
        <br> "ceremonial axis" of New Delhi. It stands as a memorial to 74,187 soldiers
        <br> of the Indian Army who died between 1914 and 1921 in the First World War,
        <br> in France, Flanders, Mesopotamia, Persia, East Africa, Gallipoli and
        <br> elsewhere in the Near and the Far East, and the Third Anglo-Afghan War.
        <br> 13,300 servicemen's names, including some soldiers and officers from the 
        <br> United Kingdom, are inscribed on the gate.[2] Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens,
        <br> the gate evokes the architectural style of the ancient Roman triumphal arches 
        <br> such as the Arch of Constantine in Rome, and later memorial arches; it is often
        <br> compared to the Arc de Triomphe in Paris, and the Gateway of India in Mumbai.
<br><br>
Following the Bangladesh Liberation war in 1972, a structure consisting of a black 
<br>marble plinth with a reversed rifle, capped by a war helmet and bounded by 
<br>four eternal flames, was built beneath the archway. This structure, 
<br>called Amar Jawan Jyoti (Flame of the Immortal Soldier), has since
<br> 1971 served as India's tomb of the unknown soldier. India Gate is counted 
<br>amongst the largest war memorials in India and every Republic Day, the Prime
<br> Minister visits the Gate to pay their tributes to the Amar Jawan Jyoti, 
<br>following which the Republic Day parade starts. India Gate is often a location 
<br>for civil society protests, and is popular with tourists.

<section><b><h2>Design and structure</h2></b>
<p1>
    The memorial gate was designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, who was not only the main architect
    <br> of New Delhi but also a member of the Imperial War Graves Commission and one of 
    <br>Europe's foremost designers of war graves and memorials. He designed sixty-six war
    <br> memorials in Europe, including the highly regarded Cenotaph in London in 1919,
    <br> the first national war memorial erected after World War I, for which he was 
    <br>commissioned by David Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister.[13] The memorial in New Delhi,
    <br> like the Cenotaph in London, is a secular memorial, free of religious and 
    br"culturally-specific iconography such as crosses". Lutyens according to his biographer,
    <br> Christopher Hussey, relied on the "elemental mode", a style of commemoration based on
    <br> a "universal architectural style free of religious ornamentation".
<br><br>
The India Gate, which has been called a "creative reworking of the Arc de Triomphe"
<br> has a span of 30 feet (9.1 m) across the larger opening and lies on the eastern 
<br>axial end of Kingsway, present-day Kartavya Path, the central vista and main 
<br>ceremonial procession route in New Delhi.[13] The 42-metre-tall (138 ft)
<br> India Gate stands on a low base of red Bharatpur stone and rises in stages to a
<br> huge cornice moulding above a frieze with sunburst motifs. The shallow 
<br>domed bowl at the top was intended to be filled with burning oil on anniversaries,
<br> but this is rarely done.[citation needed] The memorial-gate hexagon complex, 
<br>with a diameter of about 625 metres (2,051 ft), covers approximately 306,000 m2
<br> (3,290,000 sq ft) in area.[citation needed]
