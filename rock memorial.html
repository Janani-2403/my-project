    <h1>VIVEKANANDA ROCK MEMORIAL</h1>
    <p>1.“In a conflict between the heart and the brain, follow your heart”, said Swami Vivekananda, one of the greatest spiritual leaders who ever lived.
        <br> 
        When you reach Kanyakumari, you can’t help but follow your heart and brain alike as the Vivekananda Rock Memorial will invite you with its stunning majesty.
        <br>
         One of the most visited tourism attractions in India, the Vivekananda Rock Memorial is located on a rock in the sea, about 500 metres from the mainland.
         <br><br>
    2.A 19th century philosopher and author, Swami Vivekananda took India’s spiritual fame to the world at the Parliament of World’s Religions held in Chicago in 1893.
    <br> 
    It was in honour of the great monk that the memorial was erected in 1970. The rock on which the memorial is built is said to be where Vivekananda attained enlightenment. 
    <br>
    Legends also say that it was on this rock that goddess Kanyakumari prayed to lord Shiva, thus attaining an important place in India’s religious premises. 
    <br>
    There is a specially preserved portion in the rock which is believed to be the imprint of the goddess’s feet. 
    <br>The memorial showcases an elegant blend of different architectural genres.
     The Sripada Mandapam and Vivekananda Mandapam are two structures to be explored in the memorial. 
     <br>There is also a life-sized bronze statue of Swami Vivekananda in the premises.
     <br><br>
     3.The rock is surrounded by the Laccadive sea where the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea form a confluence. 
     <br>The location is absolutely picturesque and will leave you wondered.

<section><b><h2>Initiation</h2></b>
<p1>In January 1962, on the occasion of Swami Vivekananda's birth centenary, a group of people formed the Kanyakumari Committee, whose objective was to put up a memorial on the rock and a pedestrian bridge leading to the rock.
    <br> Almost simultaneously, the Ramakrishna Mission in Madras began planning this memorial.[5]
<br><br>
    However, this news was not taken in good taste by a sizable population of the local Catholic fishermen.
    <br> They already had a big Cross on the rock, visible from the shore.
    <br>Local Fishermen called it as 'Kurusu Paarai' which translates to 'The rock of cross'.
    <br> They used to pray at the rock before going into the sea, and also used it as a place to dry their nets.
<br><br>
These tensions led to protests by the Hindu population, who said the rock was a place of worship for Hindus.
<br> A judicial probe ordered by the Madras (now Chennai) government stated in unequivocal terms that the rock was Vivekananda Rock and that the Cross was a trespass. 
<br>Amid all this acrimony, the Cross was removed secretly in the night. The situation turned volatile, and the rock was declared a prohibited area, with armed guards patrolling it.
<br><br>
The government realized that the rock was turning into an area of dispute, with Hindus claiming it to be the Vivekananda Rock and the Christians claiming that it was St. Xavier's Rock. 
<br>It decreed that although the rock was Vivekananda Rock, there would be no memorial constructed on it. 
<br>The then Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Bhaktavatsalam, said that only a tablet declaring that the rock was associated with Swami Vivekananda could be put up, and nothing else.
<br> With government's permission, the tablet was installed on the rock on 17 January 1963.[7]
